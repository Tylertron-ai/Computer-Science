# boolean expression
# A mathematical formula
# can only answer in true or false
# Are my shoes tied? = True
# is 5 > 7 = False
print (5 > 7)   # = True

# comparison operators! == > < <= >=
# Kinda like arithmetic operators! + - / * ** % //
x = 5           # ser x equal to 5
print(x == 5)   # get x equals 5, ask a question
#The difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#This is a perfect test question

print(4 >= 2)       # True
print(1993 == 1993) # True
print(-90 < -99)    # False
print(10 != 10)     # False, ! = "bash / not"
